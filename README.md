## Project: text_message_analysis

### Overview

The `text_message_analysis` project focuses building a toolkit which assists in analysis of a dataset of online messages exchanged between two individuals. The toolkit contains functions which: import the data from a csv file, perform necessary cleaning procedures, and leverage Python for in-depth analysis. The primary emphasis is on visualisations that highlight the frequency and patterns of messages sent over time.

Future plans: 
- Developing tools for sentiment analysis of messages, using NLP algorithms.

## Files

- **`text_message_analysis`** - A notebook documenting the code used for the toolkit, along with demonstrations of visualisations
- **`ScatterplotByMinute.png`** - A scatterplot showing an average of frequency of messages sent according to the time of day.
- **`heatmapByHour.png`** - A heatmap showing an average of frequency of messages sent according to both the hour of the day, and day of the week.
- **`my_freq_by_date.csv`** - A csv file containing all dates within the given message dataset in one column, and the number of messages sent on that day in another column.
