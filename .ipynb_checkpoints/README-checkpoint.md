## Project: text_message_analysis

### Overview

The `text_message_analysis` project focuses building a toolkit which assists in analysis of a dataset of online messages exchanged between two individuals. The toolkit contains functions which: import the data from a csv file, perform necessary cleaning procedures, and leverage Python for in-depth analysis. The primary emphasis is on visualisations that highlight the frequency and patterns of messages sent over time.

Future plans are for building functions for sentiment analysis of messages.
